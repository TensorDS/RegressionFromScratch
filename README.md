# RegressionFromScratch

Developed by Tensor Data Scientists LLC

This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook and two identical spreadsheets, one in ods format and one in xlsx format. 

The Jupyter notebook shows you how to fit a multiple linear regression from scratch (using Numpy), and compute every metric in the statsmodels.api regression summary output using numpy and scipy. 

The spreadsheets show you how to do all that (except for the condition number), using just Excel or Google Sheets built-in formulas.

There is a youtube video showing some of this stuff: https://youtu.be/M_jwPqohQK8
